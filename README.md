# The hMRI-toolbox

A toolbox for quantitative MRI and *in vivo* histology using MRI (hMRI).

## Background

Neuroscience and clinical researchers are increasingly interested in 
quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (qMRI) 
due to its sensitivity to micro-structural properties of brain tissue 
such as axon, myelin, iron and water concentration (Weiskopf et al., 2015).

The hMRI-toolbox is an easy-to-use open-source and flexible tool, for qMRI data handling and processing. 
It allows the estimation of high-quality multi-parameter qMRI maps 
(longitudinal and effective transverse relaxation rates R1 and R2*, proton density PD 
and magnetisation transfer MT saturation) (Weiskopf et al., 2013), 
followed by spatial registration in common space for statistical analysis (Draganski et al., 2011).

Embedded in the [Statistical Parametric Mapping](http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm) (SPM) framework, 
it can be readily combined with existing SPM toolboxes for estimating diffusion MRI parameter maps, 
and it benefits from the extensive range of established SPM tools for high-accuracy spatial registration and statistical inferences.

The qMRI maps generated by the toolbox can be used for quantitative parameter analysis and accurate delineation of subcortical brain structures. They are key input parameters for biophysical models designed to estimate tissue microstructure properties such as the MR g-ratio and to derive standard and novel MRI biomarkers (Mohammadi et al., 2015). The hMRI toolbox is therefore a first step towards *in vivo* histology using MRI (hMRI) and is being extended further in this direction.

## Wiki-Pages

Online documentation is available as a [Wiki](https://github.com/hMRI-group/Toolbox/wiki). 
It provides guidelines and instructions for installation and usage of the hMRI-toolbox. 
These pages are work-in-progress and updated on a regular basis.
