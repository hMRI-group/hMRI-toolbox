# The hMRI Toolbox

Analysis tools for quantitative MRI and in-vivo histology using MRI (hMRI)

## Background

Quantitative MRI finds increasing application in neuroscience and clinical research due to its greater specificity and its sensitivity to microstructural properties of brain tissue - myelin, iron and water concentration (Weiskopf et al., 2015). 
The hMRI toolbox is an easy-to-use open-source tool for data handling and processing of quantitative MRI data. This toolbox, embedded in the [SPM framework](http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm), allows the estimation of quantitative MRI maps (longitudinal and transverse relaxation rates R1 and R2*, proton density PD, and magnetization transfer MT) (Weiskopf et al., 2013), followed by spatial registration in common space for statistical analysis (Draganski et al., 2011). It also offers flexibility for calculation of novel MRI biomarkers of tissue microstructure (Mohammadi et al., 2015).
